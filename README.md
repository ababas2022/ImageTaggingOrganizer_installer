# ImageTaggingOrganizer Installer

## Overview
ImageTaggingOrganizer is an AI tool designed to sort disorganized image folders by analyzing visual characteristics. Advanced AI models are used, so processing may take some time. New users are advised to start by testing the app in copy mode with a small folder. There is also an Android version for mobile use.

**Windows Installer (MSIX):**  
[Download ImageTaggingOrganizer Installer](https://github.com/ababas2022/ImageTaggingOrganizer_installer/releases/tag/v1.0.0.0)

## Tag Generation and Classification
ImageTaggingOrganizer leverages cutting-edge deep learning models to analyze image features and generate descriptive tags (e.g., "1girl", "longhair", "reddress"). Users can select from the generated tags to classify images into folders. These classified folders can then be further organized or used as a searchable index, offering flexible ways to manage images.

## Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include additional features such as:
- Character classification models
- Work title classification models

These enhancements aim to provide specialized functionality for users with more specific needs. Contributions toward development are welcome, and regular updates will ensure that the models remain current with new anime releases and trends.

## Privacy and User Experience
Enjoy an ad-free experience with no tracking of personal data. We recommend that new users begin with a small folder in copy mode to get familiar with the app. For faster processing and enhanced performance, consider using the Windows version.
